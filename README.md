After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up. How many buttons the user can click correctly the more points he/she earns. Users can see his/her point on count screen. If user ever clicks a wrong button game finishes and program turns on its initial state and waits for user to click start button.
